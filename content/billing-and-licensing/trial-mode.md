# Trial Mode

Every new Migration Project in Warp starts in **Trial Mode**, which gives you a free, no-strings-attached opportunity to spend time evaluating the product and its capabilities.&#x20;

No matter the size or scale of your overall Migration Project, you are not required to make a purchase or provide billing information to evaluate Warp in Trial Mode.

When your Project is in Trial Mode, the following limits apply:

* We'll create a maximum of 10 **Issues**, and
* We'll assign a free allotment of **Capacity** to your Project, allowing you to perform up to 10 migrations.

### Issue Limit

When your Project is in Trial Mode, we'll limit the total number of GitHub Issues we create in your **Migration HQ** for repositories discovered in your Source environments.&#x20;

The repositories chosen for Trial Mode issues are random. If you'd like to evaluate Warp with a specific selection of repositories in Trial Mode, we recommend connecting Warp to a small environment you've created specifically for evaluation purposes.&#x20;

### Capacity Limit

To help you get started, we assign a free Capacity allotment of **10 migrations** to all new Projects when they're created.&#x20;

You can use this free trial allotment to perform migrations for the repositories connected to your Project. Just as with the issue limit, we recommend connecting Warp to a dedicated evaluation environment if you'd like to use this Capacity for testing against a specific group of repositories or migration scenarios.

### Getting The Most out of Trial Mode

Trial Mode is a great way to explore Warp's features, without requiring any purchases or even a credit card to be linked to your Project.

Trial Mode limits can make it difficult to evaluate Warp in a large production environment with more than 10 repositories. If you're considering Warp as your chosen solution for adopting GitHub, we recommend creating a one-off Project connected to a small environment you've created specifically for evaluation purposes.&#x20;

### Upgrading Your Project

Your Project is automatically upgraded from Trial Mode with any purchase of Capacity.&#x20;

Even if you're planning to migrate a very large number of repositories, only the purchase of our smallest Box size is required to upgrade your Project and remove the Trial Mode limitations.

When a Project is upgraded from Trial Mode:

* We'll automatically start to populate any uncreated **Issues** for your remaining repositories in your Migration HQ, and&#x20;
* You'll be able to make use of your purchased Capacity instantly, as soon as your payment has been processed.
