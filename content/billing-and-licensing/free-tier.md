# Free Tier

Every new Migration Project in Warp starts in our **Free Tier**, which gives you a free, no-strings-attached opportunity to migrate up to 100 repositories with Warp.&#x20;

No matter the size or scale of your overall Migration Project, you are not required to make a purchase or provide billing information to use Warp's Free Tier.

When your Project is in the Free Tier, the following limits apply:

* We'll create a maximum of 100 **Issues**, and
* We'll assign a free allotment of **Capacity** to your Project, allowing you to perform up to 100 migrations (equivalent to one **Small Box**).

### Issue Limit

When your Project is in our Free Tier, we'll limit the total number of GitHub Issues we create in your **Migration HQ** for repositories discovered in your Source environments. That means that if your source environment has more than 100 repositories, you'll only see the first 100.

The repositories chosen for Free Tier issues are random. If you'd like to evaluate Warp with a specific selection of repositories in the Free Tier, we recommend connecting Warp to a small environment you've created specifically for evaluation purposes.&#x20;

### Capacity Limit

To help you get started, we assign a free Capacity allotment of **100 migrations** to all new Projects when they're created (equivalent to one Small Box).&#x20;

You can use this Free Tier allotment to perform migrations for the repositories connected to your Project. Just as with the issue limit, we recommend connecting Warp to a dedicated evaluation environment if you'd like to use this Capacity for testing against a specific group of repositories or migration scenarios.

### Getting The Most out of the Free Tier

The Free Tier is a great way to explore Warp's features, without requiring any purchases or even a credit card to be linked to your Project.

Free Tier limits can make it difficult to evaluate Warp in a large production environment with more than 100 repositories. If you're considering Warp as your chosen solution for adopting GitHub, we recommend creating a one-off Project connected to a smaller environment you've created specifically for evaluation purposes.&#x20;

### Upgrading Your Project

Your Project is automatically upgraded from the Free Tier with any purchase of Capacity.&#x20;

Even if you're planning to migrate a very large number of repositories, only the purchase of our smallest Box size is required to upgrade your Project and exceed the Free Tier limits.

When a Project is upgraded from the Free Tier:

* We'll automatically start to populate any uncreated **Backlog Issues** for your remaining repositories in your Migration HQ (if your source environment contains more than 100), and&#x20;
* You'll be able to make use of your purchased Capacity instantly, as soon as your payment has been processed.
