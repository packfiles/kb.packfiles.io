Warp automatically generates four labels for each issue it creates, which specify:

1. The repository’s **source organization**. In the examples above, the source organization is **joey-ado-testing** in Azure DevOps.
2. The repository’s **source team**. In the examples above, the source team is **first project** in Azure DevOps.
3. The repository’s **source**. In the examples above, the source is Azure DevOps.
4. The repository’s **activity**. In the examples above, the repository is inactive.

In addition to the labels that Warp automatically generates for issues, you can also assign your own labels to any label.
