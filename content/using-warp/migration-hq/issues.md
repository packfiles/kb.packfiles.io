# Issues

The _Issues_ page of _Migration HQ_ is the list of the Project’s migrations. For each repository that Warp finds in the sources you provide (e.g. Azure DevOps), it creates an issue representing that repository.&#x20;

Repositories that have not yet been migrated appear in the open issues list:
