# Issues

The _Issues_ page of _Migration HQ_ is the list of the Project’s migrations. For each repository that Warp finds in the sources you provide (e.g. Azure DevOps), it creates an issue representing that repository.&#x20;

### The Open and Closed Issues Lists

The open issues list, which GitHub displays by default, shows the repositories that have not yet been migrated:

The closed issues list shows the repositories that have either been migrated or ignored:

### Issues

Each issue in _Migration HQ_ represents a repository, where:

* The _body_ of the issue displays detailed information about the repository, including its status.
* The _comments_ act as Warp’s user interface, where you enter commands and get responses.
