# Issues

The _Issues_ page of _Migration HQ_ is the list of the Project’s migrations. For each repository that Warp finds in the sources you provide (e.g. Azure DevOps), it creates an issue representing that repository.

### The Open and Closed Issues Lists

The open issues list, which GitHub displays by default, shows the repositories that have not yet been migrated:

The closed issues list shows the repositories that have either been migrated or ignored:

### Issues

Each issue in _Migration HQ_ represents a repository, where:

* The _body_ of the issue displays detailed information about the repository, including its status.
* The _comments_ act as Warp’s user interface, where you enter commands and get responses.

#### Title

When Warp creates an issue for a repository to be migrated, it assigns the issue a name using the following format:

**\[**_source_**]\[**_repository\_name_**]**

* _source_ represents the source of the repository to be migrated (e.g., Azure DevOps).
* _repository\_name_ is the name of the repository, as specified in the source.

Repositories that have not yet been migrated are marked with GitHub’s _Open_ indicator...

...and repositories that have been migrated or ignored are marked with GitHub’s _Closed_ indicator:

#### Body

The body of an issue displays detailed information about the repository. It’s divided into the following sections:

*   fff\
