# Issue Page

### Overview

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Warp creates an issue for each repository it finds at the source.</p></figcaption></figure>

Each issue in _Migration HQ_ represents a repository, where:.

* The _body_ of the issue displays detailed information about the repository, including its status.
* The _comments_ act as Warp’s user interface, where you enter commands and get responses.

### Title

When Warp creates an issue for a repository to be migrated, it assigns the issue a name using the following format:

**\[**_source_**]\[**_repository\_name_**]**

* _source_ represents the source of the repository to be migrated (e.g., Azure DevOps).
* _repository\_name_ is the name of the repository, as specified in the source.

Repositories that have not yet been migrated are marked with GitHub’s _Open_ indicator...

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Title of an issue for a repository that has not yet been migrated.</p></figcaption></figure>

...and repositories that have been migrated or ignored are marked with GitHub’s _Closed_ indicator:

### Start of Body

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The start of an issue’s body.</p></figcaption></figure>

The issue’s body begins with the author attribution. Any issue or comment generated by Warp is attributed to the user **packfiles-warp**, followed by a rough date for when the issue was generated (e.g., “opened last week”).

The first line in the body states the purpose of the issue. It follows this format...

> This issue tracks the migration of the _\[repository\_name]_ repository from _\[source\_system]_ to GitHub.

...where:

* _\[repository\_name]_ is the name of the repository as it appears in its source system.
* _\[source\_system]_ is the name of the system that the repository is being migrated _from_ (e.g., Azure DevOps).

### Migration Status

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The <em>Migration Status</em> section for an issue whose repository has not yet been migrated.</p></figcaption></figure>

The _Migration Status_ section contains:

* The current status of the repository (e.g., “not started”, “complete”).
* A checklist of tasks that need to be completed in order to complete the migration. Warp will automatically check tasks off this list as they are completed.

### About

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The <em>About</em> section.</p></figcaption></figure>

The _About_ section, when expanded, lists details about the repository on the source system. It contains:

* The **date** when the last commit to the repository was pushed.
* The **number of commits** made to the repository in the last year.
* The **name and email address** of the repository’s most active contributor.
* The **size** of the repository.

### Source & Destination

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The <em>Source &#x26; Destination</em> section for an issue whose repository has not yet been migrated.</p></figcaption></figure>

The _Source & Destination_ section, when expanded, provides links to the source and destination repositories. It contains:

* The name and link for the source repository.
* The name of the destination repository, and if the repository has been migrated, the link to the destination repository.

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (46).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The <em>Source &#x26; Destination</em> section for an issue whose repository has been migrated.</p></figcaption></figure>

### Inventory

The _Inventory_ section, when expanded, displays information about the migrated repository, providing the date and time when the repository was migrated as well as a link to the destination repository:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (49).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The <em>Inventory</em> section for an issue whose repository has been migrated.</p></figcaption></figure>

In an issue for a repository that hasn’t yet been migrated, the _Repository Content_ section simply displays that the repository has not yet been migrated to GitHub:

### Help & Support 

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Help &#x26; Support section for an issue.</p></figcaption></figure>

The _Help & Support_ section appears near the end of the issue’s body. When expanded, it lists the ways you can get help while using Warp.

It provides links to the following resources:

* The Warp **Knowledge Base**.
* GitHub’s Copilot docs (Warp works with Copilot chat — open it and try sending questions to **@packfiles-warp!**).
* The link for **Packfiles Support**.

### End of Body

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The end of an issue’s body.</p></figcaption></figure>

The issue’s body ends with the following:

* GitHub’s **Create sub-issue** / **Add existing issue** and emoji menus.
* Author attribution (once again, any issue or comment created by Warp will be attributed to **packfiles-warp**).
* Any labels for the issue, whether they were added by Warp or a user.
* A rough date for when the issue was generated (e.g., “opened last week”).

### Comments and Slash Commands

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (50).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The comments section for an issue.</p></figcaption></figure>

In any issue created by Warp, comments serve an additional purpose: they’re your interface for issuing migration commands.

Commands to Warp are called _**slash commands**_ because they start with the “slash” (`/`) character. You’ll find the full list of slash commands on the [_Slash Commands_ documentation page](../../slash-commands/).

#### Simple Migration Example

Here’s an example of a repository migration.

To migrate a repository, you would open its issue page, scroll to the comments section, and enter the `/migrate` command into the comment box as shown below:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (51).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Seconds later, Warp will respond with a comment informing you that the migration has started, and that it will notify you when the process has completed:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (52).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

When the process is complete, Warp will post another comment informing you that the migration was successful. The comment will include a link to the new migrated repository:

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (53).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Warp automatically closes a repository’s issue after it has been migrated. The issue’s “closed” status will be indicated in the issue’s title and in a notice in the comments, which will also provide a rough date for when the issue was closed (e.g., “1 minute ago”):
