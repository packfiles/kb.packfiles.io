The _Trends_ section provides the following quantitative information about your project:

This display shows the total number of repositories that Warp found, followed by the number that were found in the past 24 hours.
* **Repositories Migrated:** The number of repositories that were migrated to GitHub. This display shows the total number of repositories that were migrated, followed by the number that were migrated in the past 24 hours.
* **Daily Average:** The average number of migrations performed per day since the project’s first migration. This display shows the average (mean) migrations per day since the first one, followed by the number of days since the first migration.
