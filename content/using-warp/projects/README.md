# Projects

Warp organizes migrations into _**Projects**_. In Warp, a Project is an object for managing a _migration engagement_ — that is, an event where you will be migrating repositories to GitHub. Projects allow you to view and manage a set of migrations as a distinct operation with its own team, timeline, and budget.

Projects are one of Warp’s ways to make migrations more manageable:

* If you have a small collection of repositories to migrate, you might choose to perform their migrations in a single engagement and use a single project.&#x20;
* If you are performing migrations for clients, you might choose to use one project for each client.
* If you have a large number of repositories to migrate — perhaps thousands, tens of thousands, or even more — you’ll want to divide that task into several migration engagements, with one project for each engagement, and spread out the projects over time.
