# Projects

### What is a Project?

Warp organizes migrations into _**Projects**_. In Warp, a Project is an object for managing a _migration engagement_ — that is, an event where you will be migrating repositories to GitHub. Projects allow you to view and manage a set of migrations as a distinct operation with its own team, timeline, and budget.

Projects are one of Warp’s ways to make migrations more manageable:

* If you have a small collection of repositories to migrate, you might choose to perform their migrations in a single engagement and use a single project.&#x20;
* If you are performing migrations for multiple clients, you might choose to use one project for each client.
* If you’re working with an organization with a large number of repositories to migrate — numbering in the thousands, tens of thousands, or even more — you’ll probably want to divide that task into multiple projects carried out over a period of time.

### The _Projects_ Page

When you sign into Warp, you are taken to the _Projects_ page, which contains the following:

* **Projects:** The list of active migration engagements, a.k.a. Projects.
* **Pending Installations:** If you have any projects that have not yet been fully set up and configured, they will appear in this list.
* _**Create a New Project**_**&#x20;button:** Starts the process of creating a new project.

### The _Projects_ List

For every active Project, the list contains an item that looks like this:

Each item has the following elements:

* The Project’s name.
* These buttons:

### The _Pending Installations_ List

For every Project that has been created but not yet set up and configured, the list that contains an item that looks like this:

Each item has the following elements:

* The Project’s name.
* The **Start Installation** button, which starts the process of setting up and configuring the Project for use.
