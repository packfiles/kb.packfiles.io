# Azure Blob Storage

The Azure Blob Storage credential type stores the Connection String associated with an Azure Blob Storage bucket.

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/intermediate-storage-hint.md" %}

To configure an Azure Blob Storage credential, you will need to provide an Azure Blob Storage Connection String. For more information about generating these, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?tabs=azure-portal#regenerate-access-keys).
