# Security at Packfiles

### Introduction

Packfiles designs security into the core of our products. As part of our mission to create the world's leading platform for enterprise-scale GitHub adoption, we cannot understate the importance of protecting our customers, their data, and the trust they've placed in us.

Packfiles' ultimate goal is to keep our customers safe. We achieve this with a combination of technologies, architectural choices, and best practices that work together to deliver a user experience that is as approachable and transparent as it is maximally secure.

Key security features in Warp, such as [customer-owned credential management](warp-security-model/credential-management.md), [private compute](warp-security-model/), and [data privacy](warp-security-model/data-privacy.md) can't be disabled or configured improperly by mistake. Because these features are inherently part of Warp's design, customers don't need to perform extensive or complicated configurations to enjoy the benefits of these protections. They're always present and active for Projects of any size.

### Our Principles

At Packfiles, we believe security isn't just a feature of our products: it _defines_ them. That's why we always start our design process by thinking about our values and principles.

We believe:

#### **Effective security is designed to be accessible.**

World-class security technologies are transparent and easy to use. Great security controls shouldn't require advanced expertise or assumed knowledge on behalf of the customer to be effective. Instead, best practices should be distilled into product design at a fundamental level.&#x20;

Rather than forcing customers to learn and apply a complicated set of security settings or configuration, we believe that the product itself should be their guide, and it should work in a way that guarantees their success.

In other words, "secure by design" is better than "secure by default", or even "secure with a bit of extra configuration". Opinionated, secure defaults that work transparently on behalf of customers raise the bar for everyone.

#### Security comes standard.

Customers shouldn't have to pay a premium for great security. Rather than segmenting our customers into security haves and have-nots, we believe the most critical security protections should come standard across all of our products, in a polished form that adheres to our accessibility principle.

#### **Security is a core primitive.**

At Packfiles, we've known from the start that an excellent security architecture is the first and most important thing to get right. That's why we take a long-term view of our security technology and architectural choices.

A strong security foundation is essential to enabling core experiences, developing innovative new features, and creating great experiences for our users. When a system is carefully designed with security as a core primitive, those properties and guarantees extend seamlessly throughout.

#### Security is a differentiator.

Our unique perspective on security isn't just about building great products like Warp. We hope to push the industry forward in designing great solutions that respect customers' right to security and privacy. Because executing on those principles while maintaining a high level of polish and usability isn't just possible, it's something that customers can and should expect.

### Programs

We're committed to helping protect our customers with leading security and privacy technologies, comprehensive security and compliance programs, and a dedicated security team that supports all Packfiles products.

Packfiles understands that our own security posture is critical in protecting our customers. That's why we maintain strict controls across our workplace, development processes, and infrastructure. To ensure these controls are effective, we regularly engage with third-party security firms to perform thorough, comprehensive audits and security testing.&#x20;
