# Security at Packfiles

### Introduction

Packfiles designs security into the core of our products. As part of our mission to create the world's leading platform for Enterprise-scale GitHub adoption, we cannot understate the importance of protecting our customers, their data, and the trust they have placed in us.

Packfiles' ultimate goal is to keep our customers safe. We achieve this with a combination of technologies, architectural choices, and best practices that work together to deliver a user experience that is as approachable and transparent as it is maximally secure.

Key security features in Warp, such as [customer-owned key management](warp-security-model/key-management.md), [private data processing](warp-security-model/data-privacy.md), and [data minimization](warp-security-model/data-privacy.md) can't be disabled or configured improperly by mistake. Because these features are inherently part of Warp's design, customers don't need to perform extensive or complicated configurations to enjoy the benefits of these protections. They're always present and active for Projects of any size.

### Our Principles

At Packfiles, we believe security _defines_ our products. It's not just a product feature. That's why we always start our design process by thinking about how new products and features fit into our values and security principles.

We believe:

#### **Effective security controls are designed to be accessible.**

World-class security technologies are transparent and easy to use. That's why we believe best practices should be distilled into the design of our products at a fundamental level, and shouldn't require advanced expertise on behalf of the customer to be effective.&#x20;

Rather than forcing customers to learn and apply a complicated set of security principles, we believe that the product itself should be their guide, and it should work in a way that guarantees their success.

In other words, "Secure by design" is better than "secure by default", or even "secure with a bit of extra configuration". Opinioniated, secure defaults that work transparently on behalf of the customer raise the bar for everyone.&#x20;

#### Security comes standard, for everyone.

#### **Security is a core primitive.**

At Packfiles, we take a long-term view of our security technology and architectural choices. We've known from the start that our security architecture is the most important part of our product to get right.&#x20;

A strong security foundation is essential to enabling core experiences, developing innovative new features, and creating great experiences for our users. That's why we're committed to helping protect our customers with leading security and privacy technologies, comprehensive security and compliance programs, and a dedicated security team that supports all Packfiles products.
