### What is Warp?

_**Warp**_**&#x20;is Packfiles’ SaaS for migrating source code repositories to GitHub from other source code hosting platforms** (currently Azure DevOps, with migrations from BitBucket and GitLab coming soon).&#x20;

Warp transforms GitHub migration from a tedious, error-prone, manual process on the command line into a smooth, automated, straightforward experience managed within GitHub.

### What’s in this documentation?

Warp is a rapidly evolving product, with constant updates and improvements. As a result, you’ll find that its documentation is constantly being updated as well.

Here’s a quick guide If you’re new to Warp, we think you’ll find these sections helpful:

* [_**What’s Warp?**_](getting-started/whats-warp.md) — A more detailed description of Warp, what it does, and its key features.
* [_**Quickstart**_](getting-started/quickstart/) — A complete step-by-step guide to performing a migration using Warp, from installing the local application on your computer to confirming that your migration was successful. \
  If you have a free trial of Warp , you’ll definitely want to check out the Quickstart.
* [_**Roadmap**_](product/roadmap.md) — A quick overview of Warp’s current feature set and the migrations it currently supports, with a glimpse into what we plan to release in the future.
* [_**Warp’s Security Model**_](security/warp-security-model/) — A review of Warp’s approach to security, which comes from recognizing that your source code is mission-critical and contains confidential data, and that migrating it requires using highly-privileged credentials.
* [_**Billing and Licensing Overview**_](billing-and-licensing/overview.md) — Find out how much it costs to use Warp. Best of all, our small (100 migrations) and medium (1,000 migrations) have their prices listed using _actual dollar figures_ instead of “call us!”

We're continuously adding new material here, including comprehensive coverage of Warp’s features and commands, advanced topics, best practices, and emerging use cases.
