# What's Warp?

Warp is a next-generation solution for organizations seeking to adopt GitHub's products. It's designed by [Packfiles](https://packfiles.io) to unlock speed, efficiency, and collaboration across the entire journey of migrating their data, development processes, and teams away from their original platform and onto the latest and greatest tools available.

Warp is distributed as a [GitHub App](https://pack.fm/warp) that can be installed directly from the GitHub Marketplace, with a fully self-service setup and configuration process that takes less time than going to lunch. And because Warp includes a [built-in free trial](../billing-and-licensing/trial-mode.md), it's easy for teams to assess Warp's capabilities flexibly, on their own schedule, and with no upfront financial commitments.

Warp has everything you need to achieve success on your migration journey, including:

* [Advanced security features](../security/warp-security-model/) that are seamless, easy to use, mitigate risk, and respect your privacy,&#x20;
* A fair, flexible, and transparent [licensing model](../billing-and-licensing/overview.md) with no surprises,&#x20;
* Built in [reporting](../using-warp/projects/dashboard.md) and [project management](../using-warp/migration-hq/issues/) tools that make work visible, collaborative, and straightforward to plan,
* A [GitHub-native experience](../using-warp/migration-hq/) that lets your team use the tools they already know and love, and
* A wide range of available [support options](../using-warp/support/) to assure the success of your team, from [built-in assistance](../using-warp/support/copilot-chat.md) to help from our [expert partners](../using-warp/support/partners.md).
