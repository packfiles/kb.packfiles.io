# Install the Prerequisites

### Objective

Before you can use Warp, you must have the following applications installed on your local computer:

1. **GitHub command-line interface (CLI)**. Warp uses an extension to the [GitHub command-line interface](https://cli.github.com/) to send key credentials data to your _Migration HQ_ repository in GitHub.
2. **The Warp command-line extension.** This utility assembles the secure vault file containing tokens authorizing access to your source and destination repositories, generates the key to unlock the vault file, and puts both in your _Migration HQ_ repository.

**At the end of this section, you will have confirmed that you have the tool necessary for using Warp installed on your local computer.**

### Install the GitHub CLI

First, see if the GitHub CLI is installed on your computer.

🛠️ Open your terminal application (on Windows, it’s _Windows PowerShell_ or _Command Prompt_; on macOS and Linux, the default terminal is named _Terminal_).

🛠️ Enter the following command:

```bash
gh --version
```

If the GitHub CLI is installed, you’ll see a message showing its version number and the URL for its release notes. Here’s an example:

```bash
gh version 2.63.1 (2024-12-03)
https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/tag/v2.63.1
```

If you see an error message instead, you’ll need to install the GitHub CLI. Go to the [GitHub CLI page](https://cli.github.com/) and follow the instructions there.

### Install the Warp Command-Line Extension

🛠️ Once you’ve confirmed that the GitHub CLI is installed on your computer, enter the following command to install the Warp command-line extension:

```bash
gh extension install packfiles/gh-warp
```

🛠️ Confirm that the Warp command-line extension is installed by running the following command in a terminal window:

```bash
gh warp
```

You should see this response:
