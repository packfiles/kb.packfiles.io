# Gather Your Credentials

### Objective

In order to migrate your repositories, you must provide Warp with two key sets of credentials:

1. Credentials authorizing access to the repositories at the source.
2. Credentials authorizing the creation of new repositories at the destination organization in GitHub.

{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/search-for-the-emoji-if....md" %}

### Get the Credentials for the Source

First, let’s get the credentials for the source — that is, the system that you’re migrating repositories _from_.

🛠️ Select the source below and follow the instructions on that page. Once you’re done, proceed to the next section on this page:

* [Azure DevOps](get-your-azure-devops-credentials.md)
* Atlassian BitBucket (coming soon)
* GitLab (coming soon)
