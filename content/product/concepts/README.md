# Core Concepts

Packfiles was founded by a team of passionate experts with a unique perspective on developer technologies. We've helped countless organizations around the world adopt efficient development practices, streamline their processes, and get the most out of the best tools available, particularly GitHub.

You may wonder why Warp exclusively supports GitHub products as the destination for migrated data. The answer is simple: First, we believe GitHub's offerings are best in class, bar none. And second, we have a long history of working within, around, and across GitHub's business. Our team's collective experience represents longtime users of the platform, former GitHub employees, world-class services partners, and vendors of developer tools that integrate with GitHub.

This section covers the key concepts of our approach to GitHub adoption that we've applied successfully for organizations around the world and across industries. You'll understand the principles, design philosophy, and rationale that have influenced the design of Warp, and how they work together to create an experience that empowers your organization to efficiently and effectively tackle the challenge of GitHub adoption.

### Our Beliefs

We believe that:

* Adopting the world's best developer tools should be as easy as using them.&#x20;
* Our products should put customers in control. They should unlock speed, productivity, and allow you to move at the most comfortable pace for your organization's priorities.
* Our products should be designed to eliminate bottlenecks. And they should empower teams by increasing their ability to communicate, collaborate, and share context.
* We should meet people where they are by delivering a polished, accessible experience that's easy for people to use and understand.
* We must respect our customers' right to the privacy and security of their data, without compromising on usability and safety.
